# Problem 3 - Largest Prime #

## Ruby ##
Two branches, master uses the Prime class for conciseness, alternate branch answers it making less complete use of ruby built-in support.

## Node.js ##
Borrows some code from  [http://www.javascripter.net/math/primes/factorization.htm ](http://www.javascripter.net/math/primes/factorization.htm )  but with modification to return array of prime factors rather than an assembled string of factors.

Not as elegant in the recursion stopping condition as I would like.
