# Problem 7 - 10001st Prime #

## Ruby ##
Re-using an exercism.io solution which uses this problem.  This in turn uses an Eratosthenes sieve coded for an earlier exercism exercise.  The increasing search in the test file takes many minutes to find the 10001st prime.

Then, for fun, re-solved using Ruby's built-in Prime class for performance comparison (P7.rb), which takes &lt;0.2 seconds)
